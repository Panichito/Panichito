<h3 align="left">About me 👨‍💻:</h3>

- [x] 👋 Hi, my name is **Panithi** *(pa-ni-ti)*. My nickname is **Big**!
- [x] 🔎 *```Panichito```* is my name combined with the word *```despacito```* to remind me that when I do something, don't rush and pay attention to my surroundings (comparable to *a slow, steady step*).
- [x] 👀 Interested in *Quantum Programming & Computing*
- [x] 🌱 Currently learning *Linear Algebra & Mathematical Optimization*
- [x] 📚 Major in Computer Engineering. Like any software devs, I have primarily published work regarding websites and applications. Sadly, this type of job doesn't excite me as much as employing *algorithms* to solve problems (especially math).
- [x] 💞️ Looking to collaborate on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/panithi-suwanno-89171a1a3/)
- [x] 📫 How to reach me panithi2001big@gmail.com
